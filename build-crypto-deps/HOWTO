1 - HOWTO COMPILE ALL LIBS AND RUN THE TEST PROGRAM
====================================================

1.1) sh build-all-deps.sh `pwd`/binaries 

    It will take about an hour to compile both libraries for the iPhoneOS and 
    iPhoneSimulator, Debug and Release, for the 3.0 SDK using GCC 4.2.

    If you want to use any other SDK change the SDKLIST variable in the 
    build-all-deps.sh script.

    For ex.:
      SDKLIST="2.2.1 3.0"

1.2) Open the ImapClient3.0.xcodeprj and run it.

    Note that XCode will look for openssl, cyrus-sasl and libetpan in the 
    binaries/ subdir of the current directory; we built that dir in the 
    step 1.1).

2 - HOW TO ADD MAILCORE AND ITS DEPENDENCIES TO YOUR PROJECT
=============================================================
  
2.1) First of all compile MailCore dependecies following the step 1.1

     To integrate MailCore in your project you've to import MailCore source 
     files, import static libraries and change the search path for both 
     Headers and Libraries in your target configuration.

2.2) Import MailCore files 
    
     Open the package folder in Finder and drag the MailCore directory
     over the "Classes" item in the Groups & Files pane of XCode.

     On the import dialog check the "Copy items into destination..." checkbox.

2.3) Import the static libs

     Open the package folder in Finder, find the following libs and 
     drag them in the Frameworks item in Groups & Files:

        libetpan.a
        libcrypto.a
        libssl.a
        libsasl2.a

     Any version of those lib will do, we'll tell XCode how to find the right
     one (i.e. those based on the selected SDK and Configuration) in the next 
     step.

     In the import dialog do NOT check the "Copy item into destination...".

     For example you can import libs from:

        ${BINARIES}/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneOS3.0.sdk/Release/lib/

    The BINARIES var here is the installation directory given to the script in 
    the step 1.1.

2.4) Change the search paths of libs and headers

     CTRL-click on your project under the Target item in the Groups & Files 
     pane and choose "Get Info".

     Select the Build tab on the top bar.

     Find the Header Search Paths variable and set to:

        "PATH_TO_YOUR_BINARIES_DIR_HERE/$(SDKROOT)/$(CONFIGURATION)/include"

     Find the Library Search Paths variable and set to:

        "PATH_TO_YOUR_BINARIES_DIR_HERE/$(SDKROOT)/$(CONFIGURATION)/lib"

2.5) Link to libiconv library (provided by Apple)

     CTRL-click on your project under the Target item in the Groups & Files 

     Select the "General" tab.

     In the Linked Libraries section at the bottom of the window click on the
     "+" button.

     Select "Dylibs" in the combo box and click on 

        libiconv.dylib
